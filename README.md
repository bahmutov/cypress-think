## Agent instructions

This package automatically discovers your agent instructions and includes them with your prompts, see [agent-instructions.mjs](./src/agent-instructions.mjs)

```
Found agent instructions in: .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

## Caching

Each prompt line is processed separately. Each result is cached to avoid reinventing the same code. If the line changes, it will be re-generated.

![Caching symbol](./images/caching.png)

The cache is loaded and saved in the local `thoughts.json` file.

## Saving generated code

If the entire prompt finishes successfully, a save icon ðŸ’¾ appears next to the "thinking" log message

Save replaces the original `.think(prompt)` with the generated `.within(...)` commands plus comments
